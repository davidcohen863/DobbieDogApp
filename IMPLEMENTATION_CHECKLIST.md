# Implementation Checklist ‚úÖ

Use this checklist to verify your multi-user setup is complete and working.

## Phase 1: Database Setup

### SQL Migrations
- [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
- [ ] Run `supabase_migrations/00_schema_requirements.sql`
  - Check for errors
  - Note: Most tables likely already exist (that's OK)
- [ ] Run `supabase_migrations/01_rls_policies.sql`
  - Verify "Success" message
  - Check that all helper functions were created
  - Verify all triggers are active

### Verify RLS Policies
```sql
-- Run this query to verify RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN (
    'families', 'family_members', 'family_invites', 
    'dogs', 'activity_logs', 'reminders', 'reminder_occurrences'
  );
```
- [ ] All tables show `rowsecurity = true`

### Verify Helper Functions
```sql
-- Check all functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN (
  'is_family_member',
  'user_family_ids', 
  'has_dog_access',
  'accept_family_invite',
  'accept_family_invite_by_code',
  'create_family_share_code'
);
```
- [ ] All 6 functions returned

## Phase 2: Realtime Configuration

### Enable Realtime on Tables
Go to: **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Replication**

- [ ] `activity_logs` - Realtime enabled
- [ ] `dogs` - Realtime enabled
- [ ] `reminders` - Realtime enabled
- [ ] `reminder_occurrences` - Realtime enabled
- [ ] `family_members` - Realtime enabled
- [ ] `families` - Realtime enabled

**How to verify:** Each table should show "Realtime is enabled" in the Replication panel.

## Phase 3: Data Migration (If Needed)

### If You Have Existing Users
Only needed if you have existing data in the `dogs` table.

```sql
-- 1. Create families for existing users
INSERT INTO families (id, name, created_by)
SELECT 
  gen_random_uuid()::text,
  'My Family',
  user_id
FROM dogs
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_id
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- 2. Add creators as family members  
INSERT INTO family_members (family_id, user_id)
SELECT f.id, f.created_by
FROM families f
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

-- 3. Link dogs to families
UPDATE dogs d
SET family_id = f.id
FROM families f
WHERE d.user_id = f.created_by
  AND d.family_id IS NULL;

-- 4. Verify migration
SELECT 
  d.name as dog_name,
  f.name as family_name,
  u.email as owner_email
FROM dogs d
JOIN families f ON d.family_id = f.id
JOIN auth.users u ON f.created_by = u.id::text;
```

- [ ] All existing dogs have a `family_id`
- [ ] All users are members of their family
- [ ] Query above shows all dogs correctly linked

## Phase 4: Code Verification

### Swift Files Updated
- [ ] `SupabaseManager.swift` - Contains member management functions
- [ ] `SupabaseManager.swift` - Contains family realtime sync
- [ ] `SettingsView.swift` - Shows family members section
- [ ] `SettingsView.swift` - Has member management actions
- [ ] `SetupView.swift` - Supports join-by-code flow (already exists)

### Check Console Logs
Build and run the app, check Xcode console for:
- [ ] "‚úÖ Realtime v2 subscribed..." appears
- [ ] "‚úÖ Family realtime v2 subscribed..." appears
- [ ] No "‚ùå" errors related to RLS or permissions

## Phase 5: Functional Testing

### Test 1: Solo User Flow
- [ ] Create new account
- [ ] Set up first dog
- [ ] Open Settings ‚Üí Family section appears
- [ ] Settings shows "My Family" with you as sole member
- [ ] Log an activity ‚Üí appears immediately

### Test 2: Invite Generation
- [ ] Settings ‚Üí "Generate share code"
- [ ] Modal shows 6-character code (e.g., "ABC123")
- [ ] Code appears in "Pending Invites" list
- [ ] "Copy" button copies code to clipboard

### Test 3: Join Family (New User)
**On second device or simulator:**
- [ ] Create new account
- [ ] During setup: Toggle "Join existing family" ON
- [ ] Paste share code from Test 2
- [ ] Tap "Join"
- [ ] "Setup Complete" appears
- [ ] Home screen shows first user's dog

### Test 4: Real-time Collaboration
**Device 1 (User A):**
- [ ] Log a walk

**Device 2 (User B):**
- [ ] Walk appears within 2 seconds (no manual refresh)

**Device 2 (User B):**
- [ ] Log a meal

**Device 1 (User A):**
- [ ] Meal appears within 2 seconds

### Test 5: Member Management
**Device 1 (Family Creator):**
- [ ] Settings ‚Üí Family Members shows both users
- [ ] ‚ùå button appears next to second user
- [ ] Tap ‚ùå to remove second user

**Device 2 (Removed User):**
- [ ] Loses access to dog data immediately
- [ ] "No dog profile found" or similar error

### Test 6: Leave Family
**Prerequisite:** Re-invite User B

**Device 2 (User B):**
- [ ] Settings ‚Üí "Leave Family" button visible
- [ ] Tap "Leave Family"
- [ ] Confirmation appears
- [ ] After leaving, no longer sees family data

**Device 1 (User A):**
- [ ] User B disappears from members list within 2 seconds

### Test 7: Security Isolation
**Device 2 (User B, not in any family):**
- [ ] Cannot see User A's dog in any way
- [ ] Cannot access activities from User A's family
- [ ] "No dog profile found" message appears

## Phase 6: Edge Cases

### Multiple Families
- [ ] User A creates Family 1
- [ ] User B creates Family 2
- [ ] User A joins Family 2 via code
- [ ] User A can switch between families in Settings
- [ ] Dogs shown change when switching families

### Invalid Codes
- [ ] Entering wrong code shows error
- [ ] Expired invite shows error (test by setting `expires_at` to past)
- [ ] Revoked invite shows error

### Concurrent Editing
- [ ] User A edits activity notes
- [ ] User B edits same activity at same time
- [ ] Last save wins (or conflict UI shown)
- [ ] No crashes or data corruption

## Phase 7: Performance Check

### App Performance
- [ ] Settings loads in < 1 second
- [ ] Family members list loads instantly
- [ ] Switching families is smooth
- [ ] Realtime updates don't lag the UI

### Database Performance
```sql
-- Check query performance (should be < 100ms)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT d.* FROM dogs d
WHERE d.family_id IN (
  SELECT family_id FROM family_members
  WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id'
);
```
- [ ] Query time < 100ms
- [ ] Uses indexes (shows "Index Scan" in plan)

## Phase 8: Production Readiness

### Documentation
- [ ] README.md reviewed and accurate
- [ ] QUICK_START.md tested and working
- [ ] MULTI_USER_SETUP.md covers all scenarios
- [ ] TESTING_GUIDE.md followed successfully

### Error Handling
- [ ] Network errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Permission errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid inputs rejected with helpful feedback
- [ ] Loading states prevent duplicate actions

### User Experience
- [ ] Haptic feedback on success/failure
- [ ] Loading indicators during async operations
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions

### Security
- [ ] API keys not hardcoded (or using environment variables)
- [ ] RLS policies tested and verified
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Supabase URL/keys kept secure

## Phase 9: Optional Enhancements

### Future Improvements (Not Required)
- [ ] Push notifications for family activity
- [ ] Activity comments/reactions
- [ ] Multiple dogs per family
- [ ] Role-based permissions (owner/admin/member)
- [ ] Offline support with sync queue
- [ ] Export data to CSV/PDF

## Quick Reference

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Check Supabase logs
Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí API

# Test RLS policies
Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Policies

# Verify realtime
Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Replication
```

**App Issues:**
```swift
// Enable verbose logging
print("üîç Debug: \(SupabaseManager.shared.getActiveFamilyId())")
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Clear UserDefaults: Device Settings ‚Üí App ‚Üí Reset
- Clear Supabase cache: `SupabaseManager.shared.clearDogCache()`
- Resubscribe realtime: `await SupabaseManager.shared.stopAllRealtime()` then restart
